// Original file was `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`, `useToast` and `toast` were re-exported from there.
// Now, this file becomes the primary source for `useToast` and `toast` if they were defined here.
// Assuming the re-export was to simplify paths.
// The actual implementation is in `src/hooks/use-toast.js` (after rename)
import { useToast, toast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"; // This import might become circular or problematic.
